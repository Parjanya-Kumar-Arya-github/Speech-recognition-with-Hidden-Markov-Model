# Speech-recognition-with-Hidden-Markov-Model
 A speech recognition system using HMM (Hidden Markov Model).
It is a project given to M.tech students so I hope it will be helpful to them.
You can speak the fruit name but it may or may not guess because the frequency of our vocals is very difference so to make a guess for your voice too you have to give an input data of your voice in the respective folder of the word you are saying.
